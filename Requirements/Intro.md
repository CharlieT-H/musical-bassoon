# Intro

This test is designed to Give us an opportunity to work through a problem and understand your approach to solving it.  
We are interested in your thought process, problem-solving skills, and coding style.


## Solution Setup
We have a Solution, FizzBuzzTest that contains two projects:
1. FizzBuzzTest.Console - This is a console application project that contains the FizzBuzz implementation.
2. FizzBuzzTest.UnitTest - This is a unit test project that contains tests for the FizzBuzz implementation.

We have already scaffolfed the basic setup for you. You will need to implement the FizzBuzz logic in the `FizzBuzz` class located in the `FizzBuzzTest.Console` project.
This is already set up with a basic loop in the program.cs file that calls the `GetFizzBuzzValue` method for numbers 1 to 100.

## Ruunning the Application
To run the console application, use `dotnet run --project FizzBuzzTest.Console` from the solution directory.
This will execute the FizzBuzz logic and print the results to the console.

## Running the Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, use `dotnet test` from the solution directory.
This will execute all the tests in the `FizzBuzzTest.UnitTest` project and display the results.
