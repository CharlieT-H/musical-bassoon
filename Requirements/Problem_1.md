# ✅ Problem 1: Classic FizzBuzz

## 📋 Requirements
Write a program that loops through numbers 1 to 100.
For each number:

* Print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3.
* Print "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5.
* Print "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
* Otherwise, print the number itself.

The Initial Counting Loop, and Unit tests have been written, you just need to implement the FizzBuzz logic inside the loop.
