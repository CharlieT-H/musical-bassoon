# ✅ Problem 7: Rule execution analysis

## 📋 Requirements
When executing the FizzBuzz logic,
At the end of the execution, output a summary report showing each rule's message and the count. When adding to this summary, only increment based on the output, i.e. if the result is 'FizzBuzz' then only increment the count for 'FizzBuzz', not for 'Fizz' and 'Buzz' separately.  
If a Number triggers three or more of the FizzBuzzRules it should be Flagged at the end of the run to show it is a special number.
At the end of the FizzBuzz execution, the program should print a summary report in the following format:

```
Rule Execution Summary:
Message: "Fizz", Count: 27
Message: "Buzz", Count: 14
Message: "FizzBuzz", Count: 6
Flagged Numbers (triggered 3 or more rules): 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90
...
```
